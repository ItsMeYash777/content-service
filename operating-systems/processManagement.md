## What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is software that acts as a **bridge between you and your computer hardware**.  
It **manages resources**, **runs programs**, and **keeps your data safe**.

> 💡 **Analogy:** Think of the OS like a **building manager**. It controls access to rooms (hardware), schedules tasks (CPU time), and ensures security.

## Main Functions of an OS

- **Hardware Management:** CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices  
- **Program Execution:** Start, pause, stop programs  
- **File Handling:** Create, read, write, delete files  
- **Security & Access Control:** User permissions, authentication  
- **User Interface:** CLI (Command Line) or GUI (Graphical Interface)

**Key Components:**

- **Kernel:** Core part controlling hardware & resources  
- **User Space:** Where user programs run  
- **System Calls:** Interface between applications and the kernel

## Types of Operating Systems

| Type              | Description                                   | Example                  |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Batch OS          | Jobs collected & run together                 | Early mainframes        |
| Time-Sharing OS   | Multiple users share the CPU                  | UNIX, Linux             |
| Real-Time OS      | Responds immediately to events               | Robotics, medical devices |
| Distributed OS    | Controls multiple computers as one system    | Hadoop, Google File System |
| Mobile OS         | Designed for smartphones/tablets             | Android, iOS            |

## Popular Operating Systems

- **Desktop:** Windows, macOS, Linux  
- **Mobile:** Android, iOS  
- **Server:** Linux distributions, Windows Server

## Why Operating Systems Matter

Without an OS, each application would have to **manage hardware directly**, making computers **very hard to use**.  
The OS **simplifies hardware access**, **allocates resources efficiently**, and **protects your data**.

> ⚡ **Key Takeaways:**  
> - The OS is the **manager of your computer**  
> - It handles **resources, programs, and security**  
> - Understanding the OS helps you see **how computers really work under the hood**
